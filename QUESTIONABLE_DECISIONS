- the Lteip.cc file (can this simply be left out or does the code have to be 
    restructured?)
- changing the inheritance hierarchy in PgwStandard.ned. inet3 used the
    NodeBase up until the network layer. Inet4 separated into nodes for four of
    the five layers (Link, Network, Transport, Application), where upper layers
    derive from the consecutive lower layer. LinkLayerNodeBase derives from
    NodeBase.
    I supplant the application layer with a NetworkLayerNodeBase.
    - got an errormessage originating from the same file originating in line 82
        NodeBase used to have a submodule networkLayer.
    - neither appIn and appOut in Udp.ned nor transportIn and transportOut in 
        INetworkLayer are vectorgates anymore, removed ++ from communication
    - Udp has no vector gate anymore. In simulte, omnet complains that gate is
        already connected. since udp only has a single gate, add a second
        udp connection for that? Does that even work? what else does it screw
        up?
    - vector of udp?
