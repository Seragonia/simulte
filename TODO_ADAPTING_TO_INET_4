- adapt makefile to recognize source files in compatiblitiy
- fix all output stuff (might work in namespace omnetpp)
- TCP might not work
- InterfaceEntry IP2Lte dead sure won't work. How da**q is InterfaceEntry constructed?
- Ipv4ControlInfo - no corresponding header file. What happened here?
- make use of the packet tag API

- src/stack/mac/packet/LteMacPdu.msg causes a conflict with unknown name. When
    compiling, add omnetpp:: before the cPacket word (namespace does not get
    resolved)
