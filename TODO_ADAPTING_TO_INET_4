- adapt makefile to recognize source files in compatiblitiy
- TCP might not work
- InterfaceEntry IP2Lte dead sure won't work. How da**q is InterfaceEntry constructed?
- Ipv4ControlInfo - no corresponding header file. What happened here?
- make use of the packet tag API
- compile error in x2/LteX2Manager. When an error occurs the first time, an 
error message

x2/LteX2Manager.cc:48:50: error: 'getName' is a protected member of 'inet::InterfaceEntry'
            const char* ifName = interfaceEntry->getName();

is obtained. Running make again WITHOUT ANY CHANGES creates

make[1]: Entering directory '/home/ich/libs/simulte/from_git/src'
MSGC: /home/ich/libs/inet/4.0.0/src/inet/common/packet/Packet.msg
/home/ich/libs/inet/4.0.0/src/inet/common/packet/Packet.msg:16: Error: syntax error, unexpected NAME, expecting $end

Deleting everything and recompiling recreates the first error message, however
recompiling again nets the exact same error. One workaround around the expensive
recompilation of the entire package is to delete the out/.../src/x2 folder alone
(which contains the corresponding object file). I failed in choosing a different
compiler
