- adapt makefile to recognize source files in compatiblitiy
- fix all output stuff (might work in namespace omnetpp)
- TCP might not work
- InterfaceEntry IP2Lte dead sure won't work. How da**q is InterfaceEntry constructed?
- Ipv4ControlInfo - no corresponding header file. What happened here?
- make use of the packet tag API

- src/stack/mac/packet/LteMacPdu.msg causes a conflict with unknown name. When
    compiling, add omnetpp:: before the cPacket word (namespace does not get
    resolved)
- replaced registerSignal with omnetpp::cComponent::registerSignal (which
    the author messed up before **hem, hem**) in src/x2/X2AppClient.cc. In inet,
    a registerSignal function is used several times with no explicit cComponent
    prefix. I am unsure whether there are multiple implementations of the 
    function or there is some alias buried somewhere in INET. (This is one
    place where using the IDE might be helpful)
