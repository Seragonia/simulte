- fix all output stuff (might work in namespace omnetpp)
- TCP might not work
- InterfaceEntry IP2Lte dead sure won't work. How da**q is InterfaceEntry constructed?
    - we'll see how and if it crashes.
- Ipv4ControlInfo - no corresponding header file. What happened here?
- make use of the packet tag API

- replaced registerSignal with omnetpp::cComponent::registerSignal (which
    the author messed up before **hem, hem**) in src/x2/X2AppClient.cc. In inet,
    a registerSignal function is used several times with no explicit cComponent
    prefix. I am unsure whether there are multiple implementations of the 
    function or there is some alias buried somewhere in INET. (This is one
    place where using the IDE might be helpful)
- <!> Error: The following NED types could not be fully resolved due to a missing base type or interface: lte.apps.alert.AlertReceiver
    Now there seems to be a generic interface. Switching from Terminal to IDE Mode (edit: Nope
    isn't an IDE supposed to make work easier?)
- run simulations with the old framework and look for differences
